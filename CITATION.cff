  OCTOPUS is a multiformat splitter & converter tool for
  SeaDataNet (SDN) formats. It is a unique and ergonomic
  tool for many format conversions.

  The following conversions are possible with OCTOPUS:
  - Non SDN MedAtlas to SDN MedAtlas
  - Non SDN MedAtlas to SDN ODV
  - Non SDN MedAtlas to SDN NetCDF
  - Non SDN NetCDF Shipboard ADCP to SDN NetCDF
  - SDN MedAtlas to SDN ODV
  - SDN MedAtlas to SDN NetCDF
  - SDN ODV to SDN NetCDF
  - SDN NetCDF to SDN ODV

  And for marine geophysical data:
  - MGDv81 to SDN ODV
  - MGDv98 to SDN ODV

  OCTOPUS also allows:
  - to split a multistation file into monostation ones
  - to extract 1 to n stations from a multistation file and
  export them into another multistation file or several
  monostation ones
  - to check the compliance of SDN MedAtlas, SDN ODV, SDN
  NetCDF and HFRadar NetCDF formats
  - to check the compliance of ODV variant SDN formats for
  biology, microlitter and flow cytometry
  - to convert EGO glider files to SDN netCDF (CFPoint)
  format
  - to generate the SDN coupling table
